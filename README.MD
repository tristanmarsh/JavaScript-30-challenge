# JavaScript 30 Day Challenge
---
Repo for my solutions to Wes Bos' 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenge https://JavaScript30.com

## Day 1 - Drum Machine
[Drum Machine](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/1-drum-machine/)
My solution is not as succinct, but keeps the separation of concerns clearer and lets the function names reflect the functionality.

## Day 2 - CSS + JS Clock
[CSS + JS Clock](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/2-clock/)
This was fun! Challenging to represent the final degrees subsisting of the component time units in a readible way.

## Day 3 - CSS VARIABLES
[CSS Variables](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/3-css-variables/)
Continuing to learn programmatic JS controlled¬†style, which despite IMO being more prone than css to becoming unmanageable, is undeniably handy. Fan of the `<HTMLElement>.dataset` proprty mechanism! üëè

## Day 4 - Array Cardio 1
[Array Cardio 1](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/4-array-cardio-1/)
Fun times concreting recent attempts to take initial steps towards writing "functionally", `reduce` is still quite foregin and really seems to require the spread operator to be even remotely useful and not become as verbose as a for loop. Realised I have a lot to learn about XRH and CORS when attempting to `fetch` data from wikipedia.
