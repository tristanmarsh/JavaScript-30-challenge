# JavaScript 30 Day Challenge
---
Repo for my solutions to Wes Bos' 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenge https://JavaScript30.com

## Day 1 - Drum Machine
[Drum Machine](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/1-drum-machine/)
My solution is not as succinct, but keeps the separation of concerns clearer and lets the function names reflect the functionality.

## Day 2 - CSS + JS Clock
[CSS + JS Clock](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/2-clock/)
This was fun! Challenging to represent the final degrees subsisting of the component time units in a readible way.

## Day 3 - CSS VARIABLES
[CSS Variables](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/3-css-variables/)
Continuing to learn programmatic JS controlled¬†style, which despite IMO being more prone than css to becoming unmanageable, is undeniably handy. Fan of the `<HTMLElement>.dataset` proprty mechanism! üëè

## Day 4 - Array Cardio 1
[Array Cardio 1](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/4-array-cardio-1/)
Fun times concreting recent attempts to take initial steps towards writing "functionally", `reduce` is still quite foregin and really seems to require the spread operator to be even remotely useful and not become as verbose as a for loop. Realised I have a lot to learn about XRH and CORS when attempting to `fetch` data from wikipedia.

## Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery
[Flex Panel Gallery](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/5-flex-panel-gallery/)
This is my jam! The JS was very basic class togglers (with the newly learnt `transitionend` event). But it's high impact thanks to Flexbox, thoughtful and queued transitions, and my new favourite API...  source.unsplash.com. This isn't very useful but it's beautiful.

## Day 6 - AJAX Type Ahead
[AJAX Type Ahead](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/6-type-ahead/)
Pretty neat demo project. This answered some of my questions about the fetch API that I attempted to add to (Day 4 - Array Cardio 1)[https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/4-array-cardio-1/; need to interpret the blob objects stream according to it's file type. I attempted to structure the functionality with a clearer seperation of concerns and to optimise for readability/maintenance/extensibility. I wrote functions instead of using copy pasted regex, and added localStorage caching of the cities data API.

## Day 7 - Array Cardio 2
[Array Cardio 2](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/7-array-cardio-2/)
Super quick demo to express helpful predicates with array methods `some`, and `every`. Also was not aware of the handy lambda based `findIndex` method.

## Day 8 - HTML5 Canvas
[HTML5 Canvas](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/8-html5-canvas/)
Cool demo to learn a little about the canvas object. üë®‚Äçüé® I can't imagine myself investing the time required to get into the docs and become proficient anytime too soon as the pragmatic applications seem limited. Would certainly learn a library if future projects required such functionality.

## Day 9 - Dev Tool Domination
[Dev Tool Domination](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/9-dev-tool-domination/)
Learnt of the `assert`, `dir`, `dirxml`, `group`, `count`, `clear` console methods and their variations. Not likely to start using much of them anytime too soon as I'm in the habit of stipping out console output before comitting or deploying to production.

## Day 10 - Hold Shift Check Boxes
[Hold Shift Check Boxes](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/10-hold-shift-check-boxes/)
Watched the first 2 minutes of the video to get the idea and went and implemented. Not perfect but will finish video later tonight. Realised you can of course use querySelector on any DOM node, not just the document.

## Day 11 - Custom Video Player
[Custom Video Player](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/11-custom-video-player/)
Similar event handling and internal state management to the [Day 8 - HTML5 Canvas](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/8-html5-canvas/) demo. Interesting learning the method and properties of a video object. üëç


## Day 12 - Key Sequence Detection
[Key Sequence Detection](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/12-key-sequence-detection/)
So pretty

## Day 13 - Slide In On Scroll
[Slide In On Scroll](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/13-slide-in-on-scroll/)
Nothing new here for me. I'm familiar with implementing this with [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) and know how error prone this kind of effect can be. Definitely use a library.
