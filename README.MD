# JavaScript 30 Day Challenge

Repo for my solutions to Wes Bos' 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenge https://JavaScript30.com

## Day 1 - Drum Machine
[Drum Machine](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/1-drum-machine/)
My solution is not as succinct, but keeps the separation of concerns clearer and lets the function names reflect the functionality.

## Day 2 - CSS + JS Clock
[CSS + JS Clock](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/2-clock/)

## Day 3 - CSS VARIABLES
[CSS Variables](https://tristanmarsh.github.io/JavaScript-30-challenge/3-css-variables/)
